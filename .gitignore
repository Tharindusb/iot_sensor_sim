# these files should generally be ignored.
/target/

# Build artifacts are stored in the `target` directory.
# `cargo clean` will remove this directory.
#
# Note: If you have a workspace, you might want to ignore `/target/`
# at the root of your workspace instead of in each individual crate.
#
# If you are using a custom `target` directory, you should ignore that instead.
# For example, if you use `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=build cargo build`, then you
# should ignore `/build/`.

# Depending on your project, you may want to uncomment some of the following.
#
# If you are using a `rust-toolchain.toml` file, you might want to ignore
# the `.rustup` directory that `rustup` creates for local toolchains.
# .rustup/
