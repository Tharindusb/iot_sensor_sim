# Whether it's the result of `cargo build` or `cargo install`,
# these files should generally be ignored.
/target/

# Build artifacts are stored in the `target` directory.
# `cargo clean` will remove this directory.
#
# Note: If you have a workspace, you might want to ignore `/target/`
# at the root of your workspace instead of in each individual crate.
#
# If you are using a custom `target` directory, you should ignore that instead.
# For example, if you use `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=build cargo build`, then you
# should ignore `/build/`.

# Depending on your project, you may want to uncomment some of the following.
#
# If you are using a `rust-toolchain.toml` file, you might want to ignore
# the `.rustup` directory that `rustup` creates for local toolchains.
# .rustup/

# If you are using `cargo-watch`, you might want to ignore its temporary files.
# .cargo-watch/

# If you are using `cargo-audit`, you might want to ignore its cache.
# .cargo-audit/

# If you are using `cargo-tarpaulin`, you might want to ignore its output.

# If you are using `cargo-fuzz`, you might want to ignore its output.

# If you are using `cargo-nextest`, you might want to ignore its output.

#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
